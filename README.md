# Recognizing UVA Landmarks with Neural Networks

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook developed for a machine learning class, focusing on the recognition of landmarks at the University of Virginia (UVA) using neural networks.

## Project Overview
The project aims to build an image recognition system that classifies different buildings and landmarks on the UVA Grounds. It showcases the implementation of custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures and the application of transfer learning using pre-trained models.

##Steps and Methodology
Dataset Processing: Utilization of a subset of a large dataset, resized and compressed for the project. The data consists of images representing various classes of UVA landmarks.

Custom CNN Architecture: Design and implementation of a custom CNN model. Key considerations include the number of layers, node count per layer, choice of activation functions, and total parameters.
Transfer Learning with Pre-trained Networks: Improvement of performance through transfer learning, employing pre-trained models with adjustments to fit the project requirements.

Reflection and Analysis: Comparative analysis of custom-built networks and pre-trained models, focusing on performance differences, architectural distinctions, and overall learning experience.
